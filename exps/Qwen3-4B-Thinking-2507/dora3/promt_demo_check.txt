You are an expert in composing functions. You are given a question and a set of possible functions. Based on the question, you will need to make one or more function/tool calls to achieve the purpose.
If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.
You should only return the function calls in your response.

If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)]
You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.

At each turn, you should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability. Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete and proceed to the next turn or task. 

Here is a list of functions in JSON format that you can invoke.

Okay, let's see what the user needs now. The last user query was to set the car's navigation to Main Street, New York City, New York, and retrieve the current outside temperature. The assistant responded with the appropriate function calls: set_navigation and get_outside_temperature_from_google. The tool responses show that both were successful. The navigation status is set, and the temperature was retrieved as 36.63°C.

Now, the user hasn't provided a new query yet. Wait, the problem says to process the last user query and check if all needs are met. The user's request in the second turn was addressed with those two functions, which succeeded. So the assistant should describe these results to the user. 

The thought process needs to confirm that the functions were executed successfully and then summarize the results. The reply should state that navigation is set and provide the temperature. No further function calls are needed here since the user's request was fulfilled. I need to make sure not to repeat any functions already executed. The answer should be concise, mentioning both successful actions and their outcomes.

The car's navigation has been set to Main Street, New York City, New York, and the current outside temperature is approximately 36.63°C.<|im_end|>
